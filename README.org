* Haskell Type Demo
A quick demo I gave to friends about why the Haskell type system seems
to be objectively better than other type systems.

** Explanation
*** Caveats
- This type system is not unique to Haskell (Elm has a similar one).
- I don't believe this type system is even unique to functional
  programming languages

*** Reasons its better
1. Aesthetically the types make for more descriptive function type
   signatures.
2. It will help you catch more bugs.

** Running Programs
*** C
gcc -Wall -Werror -o main main.c && ./main

*** Go
go run main.go

*** Haskell
ghc -Wall -Werror main.hs && ./main
